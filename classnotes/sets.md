### Sets
- Orderless data structure
- No duplicates permitted
- Searching for elements is almost instantaneous

## Operations
- `size()` returns the size of the set
- `add()` will return zero if element is already found in the set
- `remove()` will return zero if element is not found in set
- `find()` will return zero if element is not found in set, returns pointer (in c++) if element is found

## Pros & Cons 
- Extremely fast when searching for an element
- No duplicates permitted
- No way to order elements

## Application Examples
- User database
