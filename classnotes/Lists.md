## Lists
- Collection of objects
- Specific position/order/index (controlled by the programmer)    

### Operations of a List  
1. `int s = size()` returns the length of the list
2. `insert(i,o)` results in the index changing of everything with a higher index than i (very slow)
3. `o = get(i)` returns the object at index i
4. `append(o)` adds o to the end of the list 
5. `remove(i)` results in the index changing of everything with a higher index than i (very slow)
6. `set(i,o)` overwrites the object at index i

### Additional Notes
- Vectors and Linked lists are the two types, each with their own advantages
- Vectors are better for size, get, set, and append
- Linked Lists are better for insert and remove
