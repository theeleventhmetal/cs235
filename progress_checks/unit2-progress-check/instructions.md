# Unit 2 Progress Check - PQ

Write a class that acts as a **priority queue** (PQ).


A priority queue is a class that stores items and then returns them based on which item has the highest value. 
For example, if 1, 2, and 3 were added to my priority queue, then they would be removed in the following order: 3, 2, 1.
